# Baseball-Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing the value of Left-Handed pitchers, and their advantages and disadvantages over Right-Handed pitchers. After the movie, Moneyball, was released, 
analytics became widely used in baseball. I believe that handedness play a big factor in baseball, more so than other sports like basketball and football, and I think that 
insights about handedness can be captured using modenrn data analytic techniques.
